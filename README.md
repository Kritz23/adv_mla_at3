==============================
We are advised to develop a data product that will enable American users to more accurately project the cost of their local air travel. The app will allow users to input travel information, and it will estimate the predicted cost of their flight. <br>

They can give details about their trip such as Origin airport, Destination airport, cabin type, etc. Users can then click a button to verify the information they have entered. The models will then be called by the Streamlit application, which will then return the predicted airfares.
